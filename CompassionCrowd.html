			<p>The number of homeless people in Dallas and Collin counties dropped slightly this year, but the number of those people actually living on the streets dramatically increased, according to data released Thursday from the annual homeless census. 
			There were 3,789 homeless people counted this year in Dallas and Collin counties, down from 3,810 last year. Of those people, 1,087 were unsheltered, up from 739 in 2016.
			The greater number of unsheltered homeless people — those living on the street, under highway overpasses and in parks — was expected because of more thorough counting achieved through an increase in the number of volunteers conducting the census. 
			But the numbers also reflect what many neighborhoods have been complaining about: More people are visibly living outside in encampments and tents throughout Dallas and surrounding cities. 
			And the ongoing shortage of affordable  housing units is making it more difficult to get people off the street, forcing people to remain homeless longer. The census shows that the average unsheltered person has been homeless for more than three years. </p>
